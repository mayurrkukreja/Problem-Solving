# Problem Solving repo

In this repository, I aim to develop a flow with problem solving questions on competitve platforms.

 


## How to use this repository ?

- I have created branches for different platforms.
- Branches also refer to algorithms and approach towards the problem-statement


#### **The branches in this repository are structured and are supposed to be developed with a lesson pattern.**
**Just like chapters in a text-book.**
